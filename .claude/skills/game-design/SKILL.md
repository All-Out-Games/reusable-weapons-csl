# Game Design Workflow

Every game is built in two phases: **Scene** (the world) then **Scripts** (the logic). Plan both up front, build the scene first, verify it, then bring it to life with scripts.

This will be a production-grade, polished game. It will not be done in one shot. **Never use placeholder art. Never write throwaway scripts.**

## Core Rules
1. Every game is multiplayer. Design for many concurrent players from the start. You must implement ownership patterns (plot-based, instance-based, per-player state on the player class) so players don't collide on shared world state. Like if you're asked to make a gardening game you must have at least 4 duplicate garden plots with ownership assigned to players on join or the game will be unplayable. 
2. Search for assets using the All Out MCP tools and world-building skill. Prefer animated Spine assets if appropriate.
3. Use the All Out engine systems/skills like Inventory, Abilities, Economy Currencies, instead of creating your own custom systems.
4. After any script change, compile with the All Out MCP compile tool.

### 1. Break Into Scene and Script Epics
**Scene epics**:
- Environment and terrain (ground, walls, decorations, lighting)
- Spawn area, player plots (if applicable)
- Interactable objects and NPCs (placed as entities with components)

**Script epics**:
- Plot assignment (if applicable)
- Match flow, game state, win/loss conditions
- Wave systems, spawners, timers
- Player abilities
- Enemy/NPC behavior and AI
- Economy, resources, progression
- Polish (tactile sfx for every action, animated particles, damage flashes, juicy effects when earning currency or harvesting plants)

### 3. Write `game_plan.json`
```json
{
  "game": "Game Title",
  "description": "One sentence",
  "scene_epics": [
    {
      "name": "Arena Layout",
      "status": "pending",
      "tasks": [
        { "name": "Search and download ground/wall/decoration assets", "done": false },
        { "name": "Place arena boundary walls", "done": false },
        { "name": "Place spawn points for players and enemies", "done": false },
        { "name": "Add decorative props to fill the space", "done": false }
      ],
      "verified": false
    }
  ],
  "script_epics": [
    {
      "name": "Enemy Wave System",
      "status": "pending",
      "tasks": [
        { "name": "Create wave manager script with timed spawns", "done": false },
        { "name": "Implement enemy pathfinding to target", "done": false },
        { "name": "Scale difficulty across waves", "done": false }
      ],
      "gate_test": "test_gate_enemy_waves",
      "gate_passed": false
    }
  ]
}
```

---

2a. Build the scene
2b. After completing a scene epic, **launch a verification subagent**. This subagent's job is to genuinely critique the work — not rubber-stamp it. **Don't write test.csl files for scene verification.**

Example verification subagent prompt:
```
Verify the "Arena Layout" scene epic for the Tower Defense game.

Use these MCP tools to critique this scene with a critical lens:
1. Call scene_hierarchy to get the full entity tree
2. Call editor_scene_screenshot to capture the current view
3. Call scene_camera to move to different positions, then screenshot again (get at least 3 angles)
4. Call scene_find_entities to confirm key entities exist: "Spawn_Point_1", "Spawn_Point_2", "Tower_Pad_1" through "Tower_Pad_6", "Base"

Evaluate against these criteria:
- NO GAPS: Is there ground/terrain covering the entire play area? Any holes or missing tiles?
- DENSITY: Does this look like a shipped game or an empty prototype? Are there enough decorative props?
- SCALE: Are towers, enemies, and the base appropriately sized relative to the lane?
- STRUCTURE: Are spawn points at lane entrances? Are tower pads along the lane? Is the base at the end?

Return a verdict: PASS or FAIL.
If FAIL, list every minor issue along with entity names and positions so they can be fixed.
```
Only set `verified: true` on the scene epic after the verification subagent passes. If it fails, fix the issues and re-verify.

---

## Phase 3 — Build the Scripts
After all scene epics are verified, build the `script_epics` in order.
Work through the `tasks` array in order:
1. Implement the task in CSL
2. Compile after every change
3. Fix errors before moving on
4. Mark the task done in `game_plan.json`

Use the appropriate engine skills as you go and constantly reference AGENTS.md.

### Step 3: Gate Test
You must have a subagent write a gate_test for every task using the `testing` skill.

Gate subagent prompt:
```
Write the gate test for the "{epic name}" script epic.

Read these skills first:
- <absolute path to testing/SKILL.md>
- <absolute path to syntax/SKILL.md>

Read these files to understand what was built:
- <list every script file the epic created or modified>

The test procedure must be named `{gate_test name}`.
It should:
- <specific assertions for this epic's deliverable>
- Take screenshots at key moments

Write the test to tests/{test_file}.csl.
After writing, compile using the All Out MCP compile tool and fix any errors.
```

### Step 4: Run the Gate Test
Use MCP `run_tests` with the gate test name.

- **Pass** → set `gate_passed: true`, set `status: "done"`, continue
- **Fail** → inspect, fix, recompile, re-run

### Step 5: Checkpoint
Update `game_plan.json` after each epic.
---

## Phase 4 — Final Verification
After all epics are done:

1. Run the full test suite
2. Take screenshots of the complete game
3. Report what was built and any remaining risks
