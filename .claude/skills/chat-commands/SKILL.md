description: Add in-game chat commands that developers can use to make their testing process easier (e.g. setting coins, resetting progress, admin tools)
---
Annotate a procedure with `@chat_command` to make it invocable via `/proc_name` in chat. Commands run on the server.

```csl
heal :: proc(player: Player, amount: int = 50) {
    player.health += amount;
    Notifier.notify(player, "Healed for %!", {amount});
} @chat_command @owner
```

## Permission Annotations

`@any` All players
`@vip` All Out VIP subscribers
`@youtuber` Verified YouTubers
`@owner` Game owner
`@owner_or_editor` Game owner and their team
(none) Platform admins only

## Parameter Rules
First parameter must be `Player`. Supported additional types: `string`, `int`/`s64`, `float`/`f64`, `bool`, `Player` (resolved by name). Default values make parameters optional.

```csl
spawn_enemy :: proc(player: Player, enemy_type: string = "zombie", count: int = 1) {
    for i: 0..count-1 {
        spawn_enemy_at(player.entity.world_position, enemy_type);
    }
} @chat_command @any
```

String arguments with spaces require quotes: `/say "Hello everyone!"`
